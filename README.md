# EE695-Capstone-Project
This repository contains all files relevant to my electronic engineering masters project, including the report, Arduino code, MatLab code, Simulink models and video clips showing the testing phase.
Folder Contents:
- Final Arduino Code: Contains a working swing-up controller and parallel PID controller for the physical system. There is also a worke in progress LQR file
- Final MatLab Files: Contain all relevent MatLab files for the finished report, including sims, modesl for the physical systems, raw output data and plotting files
- Supplier Folder: Contains all files issued by the hardware supplier. This folder is quite unorganised and has little relevent files within it but was provided weeks after the hardware was delivered
